  <!--Now let's practice some CSS! For this, you will update the index.html file and create a new CSS Stylesheet. 

    Requirements:
    - Place the existing `<h1>` and `<p>` inside of a `header` element and add a background-color to that header.
    - Create a stylesheet.css file and import it into the index.html file.
    - Add a new `div` with a class name of "info". 
      - Inside that `div` add an `<h2> My name is YOUR NAME </h2>` 
      - Add a background-color and a text color of your choice to the `h2`.
      - Add an image tag `<img>` and source an image of your main mode of transportation (you car, bus, scooter, bike, feet, etc)
      - Add an `<h3>` that explains your mode of transportation. Add a background-color and a text color of your choice.

  <h3>My method of transportation is a black 2014 Volkswagen Passat TDI. I purchased her in April of 2020, at that time
    diesel was $1.90 a gallon. Now it is more than double that :( Despite this I still love Volkswagen's
    elegent simplicity and aesthetic. The Passat was discontinued in 2023.</h3>
